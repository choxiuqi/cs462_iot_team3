** to change during deployment on fri:
[] microbit get unique broadcast only
[] microbit get 1 reading every hour
[] rpi health get 1 reading every hour
[] pir sensor debug
[] pir insert reading into DB every min
[] pir calibrate
[] send temperature sensor from microbit (temp may affect USS readings - perhaps why we get readings at night)
